 * Rolling window aggregation, one open window per server.

 * Windows are aligned to absolute time (floor of the event timestamp over the
 * window length) rather than to the first event seen. Alignment matters because
 * the evaluation harness compares a window before a deployment with a window
 * after it, and two windows are only comparable if their boundaries were not
 * chosen by whichever batch happened to arrive first.
 *
 * Exactly one window per server is open at a time. An event that belongs to a
 * window already closed is dropped and counted, because reopening it would
 * require having kept the events that built it, which is the thing this module
 * does not do. In practice the emitter batches in order and the drop count
 * stays at zero; a non-zero count is a signal that batches are arriving out of
 * order and is worth surfacing rather than hiding.
