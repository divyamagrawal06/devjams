/**
 * Join/leave pairing, and the two boundary decisions it forces.
 *
 * `mean_session_seconds` is the only metric in the rollup that is not a count,
 * and it is the one the Director reasons about when it asks whether a rule
 * change made people stay. Getting the boundary rules wrong does not produce an
 * error; it produces a number that is quietly wrong in a fixed direction, which
 * is worse. So both rules are stated here, implemented here, and tested.
 *
 * Decision 1: a session still open when a window closes is excluded from that
 * window and carried forward. It is not truncated at the boundary, because a
 * truncated length measures when the window happened to end and not how long
 * anybody played. Truncation also biases every mean downward by an amount that
 * depends on window alignment, so a before/after comparison would show a
 * "change" caused by nothing but the clock. The open join is kept in this
 * ledger, which outlives window rotation, and the full duration is credited to
 * the window in which the session actually closed. That matches the contract
 * comment on the field exactly: sessions that closed in the window.
 *
 * Decision 2: a leave with no join in the ledger contributes to `leaves` but
 * not to `mean_session_seconds`. The leave was observed, so counting it is
 * honest; the start was not, so any duration would be invented. Assuming the
 * window start is the tempting answer and it is wrong, because it manufactures
 * short sessions out of players who were already online when ingest began, and
 * it does so most often right after a deployment, which is precisely when the
 * number is being read.
 *
 * The ledger holds one timestamp per currently open player. It is bounded by
 * concurrent players, not by events, which is what keeps it compatible with the
 * no-raw-events rule.
