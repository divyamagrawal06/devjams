# telemetry

Owned by Engineer 1. Ingest at `POST /internal/telemetry/:serverId`, then rolling window
aggregation into `world_events_rollup`.

Raw events are not stored. Everything downstream reads rollups.

## Shape

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `plugin.ts` | The Elysia plugin. Mount with `app.use(telemetryPlugin({ store }))`. |
| `guard.ts` | Refuses requests carrying edge-proxy forwarding headers. |
| `events.ts` | NDJSON parsing and validation compiled from the `WorldEvent` contract. |
| `window.ts` | One open window's counters. No event is ever held. |
| `sessions.ts` | Join/leave pairing and the two window-boundary decisions. |
| `aggregator.ts` | Window rotation and handoff to the store. |
| `store.ts` | `RollupStore` plus the in-memory implementation. |

## The rules this module is built to keep

**No raw events, anywhere.** `WindowAccumulator` holds counters, a set of distinct player
names and a per-region total. Nothing in the module has an array of events, and the store
interface has no method that takes or returns one. Memory is a function of distinct players
and elapsed windows, never of event volume.

**Cluster-internal is enforced in layers.** The NetworkPolicy limits reachability, this module
refuses edge-forwarding headers, and every request must carry the shared `x-internal-key`.
Missing production configuration fails closed with 503. An accidentally proxied request still
gets `not_found`, so a scanner does not learn that `/internal/*` exists.

**Session pairing at a window boundary.** A session still open when a window closes is
carried forward, not truncated, and the full duration is credited to the window in which the
session actually closed. A leave with no join counts toward `leaves` and contributes nothing
to `mean_session_seconds`. `mean_session_seconds` is `null`, never `0`, when nothing closed.
`sessions.ts` states the reasoning; `test/telemetry-rollup.test.ts` asserts both cases.

**Player names are opaque.** They are Set keys and Map keys. Nothing parses them, matches
them, or interpolates them, and the rejection path reports schema paths rather than values so
player-authored text never reaches a log line.

## Production wiring

`DrizzleRollupStore` writes immutable closed windows to `world_events_rollup`. The Paper emitter
uses a bounded queue and Java's asynchronous HTTP client; it never sends chat content and never
blocks the game thread on telemetry delivery.
