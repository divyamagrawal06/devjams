/**

 *
 * deploy and rollback must fail without an approval token exactly as the MCP act
 * tools do: the same body, byte for byte. That holds because both call
 * approvalRequired() from the contracts package and neither assembles the object
 * itself. A hand-written literal here would pass review, match the shape, and
 * differ in one wording or one key order the first time the constructor is
 * edited. So the constructor is the only source, here and in apps/mcp and in the
 * API, and this module never touches its output.
